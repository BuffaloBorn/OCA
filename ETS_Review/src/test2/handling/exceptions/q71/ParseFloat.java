/*
 * Remove line 3, 6 -> TRUE
 * Remove line 5	-> FALSE
 * Remove line 5, 6 -> TRUE
 * Remove line 7	-> TRUE
 * Remove line 3, 7	-> TRUE
 *
 * Basically, an unreachable statement causes a compilation error (There is one exception: 
 * if(false) { ... } is valid.). As such, line 7 is unreachable because of the return 
 * statement in finally. This is because finally is always executed and there it returns a 
 * value, so there is no way line 7 can be executed!      
 * 
 * When you remove the lines suggested by the options, all the lines of code are executed 
 * in one case or another. For example, in option 1, if you comment line 3 and 6, Line 7 
 * will be executed if no exception is thrown in the try block.  We suggest you to try 
 * working out other scenarios yourself in a similar manner.
