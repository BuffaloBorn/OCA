/*
 * Note that whenever you create an array all of its elements are automatically given defaults values.
 * 
 * Numeric types are initialized to 0, objects are initialized to null, and booleans to false.
 * So if you have, float[ ] f = new float[3]; f[0], f[1] and f[2] will all be 0.0.
 * if you have Object[ ] o = new String[3]; o[0], o[1] and o[2] will all be null.
 * In this case, b1[0] and b1[1] are false.
 * whereas b2[0] and b2[1] are true and false.
 * So the answer is false and true.
