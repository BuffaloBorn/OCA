//        1.  The method in the child class must have the same signature as the method in the parent class.
//        2.  The method in the child class must be at least as accessible or more accessible than the method in the parent class.
//        3.  The method in the child class may not throw a checked exception that is new or
//            broader than the class of any exception thrown in the parent class method.
//        4.  If the method returns a value, it must be the same or a subclass of the method in the parent class, known as covariant return types.
//        5.  The method defined in the child class must be marked as static if it is marked as static in the parent class (method hiding). Likewise, the method must not be marked as static in the child class if it is not marked as static in the parent class (method o v e rri din g ) .
